# CRUD: Products management v0.1.0

## Description:
This is a simple application to perform CRUD operations on products. It is written in python.
It attempts to make it easy to switch the storage option in the future.
It has a console interface for the moment (CLI), but I want to add a GUI later.

## Requirements:
Written in python version 3.12. It may also work with older python versions.

## Setup:
Even though it does not have specific requirements, it is always a good idea to create a virtual environment:

For linux:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
. ./venv/bin/activate
```

## Usage:
